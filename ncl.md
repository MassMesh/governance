# Network Commons License

The Network Commons License is the framework that governs the network commons.

## The License (v1.0.4)

The Network Commons License (NCL) describes the terms and conditions associated with the use of free and
open networks, and so enables individuals, communities, companies, governments and other organizations to
adopt or support the same.

The NCL is rooted in the following four tenets:
- Participants are free to use the network for any purpose that does not limit the freedom of others
to do the same.
- Participants are free to know how the network and its components function.
- Participants are free to offer and accept services on the network on their own terms.
- You have the right to join the network, and the obligation to extend this set of rights to anyone according to these same terms.
the same conditions.

## Terms

### Participation
- The free network honors the human right to communication, and aims for the maximum possible
benefit for its constituents. Disputes regarding the right and proper execution of this framework
should be resolved through the consensus of network stakeholders according to these principles.
- Network devices and infrastructure can be financed and capitalized in any manner that does not
seek to profit off of other participants in the network.
- The network as a whole does not have any owner or proprietor, regardless of any specific
contribution to the network.
- Network participants agree to extend the network on the same terms and conditions that they
receive it, allowing all data to transit their own portion of the network without manipulating that
data for any reason other than network maintenance.
- Network participants agree only to the terms of this License - any other agreement must be
explicitly expressed and accepted.
- In order to maximize connectivity and network growth, network constituents are encouraged to
allow other network participants to install devices in their facilities, but this permission is always
discretionary and can be revoked at any time.
- Data from the network is not logged or stored, except where necessary to operate the network effectively or troubleshoot network problems.

### Provision of Services
The contents and services of the network, including access to the Internet are offered on their own terms.

These general principles apply:
- The free network serves only as a conduit of information - the network itself has nothing to do with
hosted services and is not liable for them.
- Content and services may be created and shared at will.
- Content creators or owners can license their creations with the license of their choice, with no
restriction. Unless otherwise stated, services are considered gratis, and offered “as is”, and
without any warranty.
- The free network makes no guarantee regarding the availability of Internet access.
- Should it become necessary to shape network traffic in order to optimize network performance,
real-time communications may be given priority over delay-tolerant forms. In the case that traffic is
shaped or manipulated, such practices must be transparently disclosed, and the exact policies in
use must be published.
- Where possible, information regarding network throughput and availability should be published to
allow the network participants to diagnose incidents by themselves.
- Network participants agree not to transmit contents that might jeopardize the well being of other
participants or operation of the network itself, including, but not limited to illegal content,
unsolicited communications, and malicious software.

### Use of Spectrum
- Participants must use spectrum reasonably and responsibly, using the minimum transmission
power necessary to achieve intended service levels.
- Coordination and cooperation should be used, whenever possible, to avoid interference and
minimize spectral pollution.
Security and Liability
- Network participants are responsible for the security of their own systems.
- Participants should assume that all information transiting the free network is visible to others, and
encrypt their communications accordingly.
- Private networks can be connected to the open network and use firewalls to regulate access and
traffic between those networks. Those private networks are not under the terms and conditions of
this License, and their owners are responsible for their own security.
- The free network is not responsible for any damage caused to or by participants in the network.
- The free network disclaims all liability for the behavior of its participants.

## Conditions
- Adoption of this License can be expressed by individuals or organizations and implies the
acceptance of the License's terms and conditions. At any time, any member can revoke this
adoption and therefore reclaim their own network devices or equipment. Device ownership is
never lost, regardless of where devices are placed.
- The Network Commons License is distributed under a Creative Commons Non-commercial,
Attribution, Share-alike license, which stipulates that derivative works are allowed, but that they
may not be used for commercial purposes, must give credit to the Network Commons License,
and must be released under these same conditions.

## About The Role of Mass Mesh
Mass Mesh exists to do the following:
- Give technical and organizational support to the neighborhood network(s).
- Give legal standing to MassMesh.org and the neighborhood networks for any purpose necessary to allow the operation of the neighborhood network(s) such as, but not limited to the following:
	- Receive donations and distribute funds
	- Occupy public and private spaces
	- Represent the network(s) publicly
	- Make agreements and notifications on behalf of MassMesh.org and the neighborhood network(s) with public administrations or third parties
	- Make interconnection agreements with other networks including other mesh networks, commercial ISPs, and IXPs
- Defend and support the interests of the neighborhood network participants, the good use of the Network Commons License, and the name of MassMesh.org by internal conflict resolution, arbitration, or when necessary, legal actions in those bad faith cases where there is damage to MassMesh.org, the neighborhood network(s) or Mass Mesh participants.

By accepting the Mass Mesh Network Commons License the participants accept the delegation of all these functions to MassMesh.org, but do not renounce their right to exercise them by themselves.
