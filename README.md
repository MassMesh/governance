# Mass Mesh Governance

Mass Mesh is a grassroots project focused on building community wireless networks in Massachusetts. To facilitate the growth of our project, set expectations about the way we operate, and keep us accountable to ourselves, we maintain our governance policies publicly in this Git repository. Here, you can find the rights and responsibilities of our [core team](members.md), as well as information about how to get involved.
