# 2020 Port Pilot Incentive

The goal of this policy is to speed the growth of a pilot network in the Port neighborhood of Cambridge in 2020/2021.

**Estimated Cost:** $400
**Estimated Time Commitment:** 6 hours (For administering the payments, verifying installs, etc.)
**Notes:** This reward will only be paid out up to 10 times, or until May 1, 2021 -- whichever comes first. After that we can evaluate whether we want to keep offering something similar.

A $40 reward will be paid to anyone who installs a mesh node that meets the following criteria:
* The node should be in the the Port neighborhood of Cambridge
* The node must be wirelessly connected to one or more other nodes
* The location of the node must be consented to by us (the core team)
* The node must be "cost-covered."

Interested installers should reach out to info@massmesh.org
