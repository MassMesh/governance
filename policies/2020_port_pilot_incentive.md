# 2020 Port Pilot Incentive

The goal of this policy is to speed the growth of a pilot network in the Port neighborhood of Cambridge in 2020/2021.

**Estimated Cost:** $400

**Estimated Time Commitment:** 6 hours (For administering the payments, verifying installs, etc.)

**Notes:** This reward will only be paid out up to 10 times, or until May 1, 2021 -- whichever comes first. After that we can evaluate whether we want to keep offering something similar.

A $40 reward will be paid to anyone who installs a mesh node that meets the following criteria:
* The node should be in the the Port neighborhood of Cambridge (And the location of the node must be consented to by us, the core team.)
* The node must be wirelessly connected to one or more other nodes
* The node owner must agree to keep the node up for at least one year. Ideally, they would intend to keep it up permanently.
* The node must be "cost-covered." Mass Mesh will not pay out of pocket for nodes eligible for this incentive.
* Node reachability will be checked automatically; the installation will become eligible for payment when the node reaches 95% uptime over 30 calendar days.

Interested installers should reach out to info@massmesh.org
