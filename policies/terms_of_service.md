# Terms of Service

The goal of this policy is to set clear expectations about our network's rules and level of service.

**Estimated Cost:** $0

**Estimated Time Commitment:** Up to 4 hours

**Notes:** The time commitment for this effort is basically just the time it takes to set up a workable system for documenting people's responses to the terms of service.

The Network Commons License (NCL,) which is in use at NYC Mesh, is a license for free and open networks. We should adopt this license as our own Terms of Service. People interested in joining the network as a node host should first be introduced to the Terms of Service, and must consent to them before being allowed to join the network. 

The NCL should be hosted in the root directory of this repository, and should be linked to in the footer of the site for easy access. When talking to interested participants about joining the network, the terms of service should be made clear before the installation date is chosen. Responses must be documented online, in a manner that is accessible to the members of the core team.
